# predict-sp500
A machine learning model trained to predict the stock price of SP500 using historical data

Right now the model is very basic and only slightly better than randomly flipping a coin after waking up everyday to bet on the trading price of the SP500 to go up. As I make more time on the weekends to spend on this, I will be adding new predictors to increase precision.
